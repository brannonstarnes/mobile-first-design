## Intro

One Hip Dog is a mockup bio website for a fake music production company. The style and branding was inspired by [Chubbies(R)](https://www.chubbiesshorts.com/collections/5-5-inseam-swim-trunks) Swim Shorts (click the link to see what I mean!).

## Purpose

I built this project with the intent to understand the flow of mobile-first design patterns in React. Prior to this project I had no experience in taking this approach, nor any experience using styled-component wrappers in React. 

## Gettin' Sketchy

Below is the basic wireframe design I sketched up using Invision.

## My Take On It

I was able to complete this project over the course of two sessions within 24 hours. In that time, I learned how to implement media queries, utilize styled component wrappers, and, ultimately, get reacquainted with React, since I've been focusing in Python/Django for the past couple of months. 

In my opinion, mobile-first is absolutely the way to go when it comes to responsiveness design. Well...at least until someone teaches me something else that blows my mind. Also, I found the styled-component wrappers to be a natural solution to CSS styling components in React. Visually, the code tells you exactly what is being applied to each component.
